This is an Othello A.I made in Python for a semester project. It was done as a 
part of a group project. We utilized alpha beta pruning with min-max to view 
the further ahead and get a balanced move. It also includes static weights for heuristics 
for different board sizes 6x6 and 8x8. 
board-tree is the directory where all of this is located. 
AI.py contains code that is also in the other files, it was just required to all be 
in one file for a later part of the project that added the files to a webserver 
so that the different groups would play against each other.
